# Description
The Credential Badges project enables users to **embed** their **Open Badge 3.0** Verifiable Credentials (VC) directly **into websites** through a simple HTML snippet. Users can paste their credential in JSON or JWT format, select from multiple templates, and generate a snippet to embed on any website or GitHub page. This snippet includes JavaScript that validates the credential.

The project is built with .NET and includes a custom library to support Open Badges 3.0. It currently supports the *did:key* and *did:prism* methods for signature verification. Future plans include adding more templates to support a broader range of Open Badge types, such as diplomas, and collaborating with credential issuers to offer customized HTML snippets.

We suggest you use the following Credential from DCC for testing.

The project is still under development and things may break ;)

# Related work
This project originated from the Cardano Ecosystem (that's the reason we also support `did:prism`) and the main project can be found [here](https://github.com/bsandmann/blocktrust.CredentialBadges).
This is a purely private project. Blocktrust is not a company and a collection of people working on SSI related problems mostly within the Cardano Ecosystem, but also outside e.g. [Blocktrust Analytics](https://analytics.blocktrust.dev)
